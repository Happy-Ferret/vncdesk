Vncdesk
=======

*Vncdesk* was originally developed for scaling up applications on high DPI
screens. Applications run in VNC desktops.


Usage
=====

Configuration for each desktop goes into a numbered directory below
``~/.vncdesk``. For example the configuration in ``~/.vncdesk/2/`` can be run
with::

  vncdesk 2 drawing.fig

Optional arguments, here ``drawing.fig``, are passed to the startup script.

Files:

* ``settings.ini``, by example::

    [desktop]
    width = 1024
    height = 768

    [window]
    title = Xfig
    name = xfig in vncdesk
    class = FigInVncdesk
    scale_factor = 2

  The ``window`` section may be omitted.

  Consider that GDK 3 will also scale the VNC viewer via the environment
  variable ``GDK_SCALE``. You may want to disable GDK scaling in case you run
  into display errors.

* ``startup``: Startup script. Environment variables provided:

  - ``WIDTH``, ``HEIGHT``: Desktop size.

  - ``DISPLAY``: Display of the VNC server.

  - ``GUEST_DISPLAY``: Display of the VNC client.

  - ``INVOCATION_DIR``: Directory in which ``vncdesk`` was started.

  - Arguments passed when calling ``vncdesk``.

  Example::

    #!/bin/sh
    xrdb -merge Xresources
    cd "$INVOCATION_DIR"
    exec xfig -geometry ${WIDTH}x$HEIGHT+0+0 "$@"

* Application specific files, for example ``Xresources``::

    xfig*image_editor: DISPLAY=$GUEST_DISPLAY xdg-open
    xfig*pdfviewer: DISPLAY=$GUEST_DISPLAY xdg-open
    xfig*browser: DISPLAY=$GUEST_DISPLAY xdg-open

* ``.password``: Generated every time anew, to password protect the connection
  also from other users on the same system.


Installation
============

1. Download a release_ from GitHub.

2. Install dependencies:

   - Python 3

   - A compatible VNC server such as TigerVNC_ 1.4 or TightVNC_ 1.3

   - gtk-vnc_ 0.5 or compatible, with the Python GTK+ 3 bindings

3. If you want to set up an explicit font path for the VNC server, at the same
   level as ``__init__.py`` create ``font_path.py``. Example contents::

     font_path = ','.join(['/usr/share/fonts/misc/',
                           '/usr/share/fonts/75dpi/',
                           '/usr/share/fonts/100dpi/',
                           '/usr/share/fonts/Type1/'])

4. Run with sufficient permissions::

     python setup.py install
